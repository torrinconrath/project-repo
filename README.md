# Overview
We wanted to develop an automatic canvas implemented kanban board to assist with managing assignments for students. So far we have developed the Kanban Board and Pomodoro Timer. This current iteration of the Kanban Board helps users manage assignments, code issues, or other to-do tasks for the user. We are aiming to implement both a user input fetching Canvas API script to allow students to have their assignments imported to the Kanban Board. Having the assignments get imported in a database, where the user can drag and drop assignments in the Kanban Board. However, this issue can only benefit students and not employees. Therefore, having the features like the Canvas Integration or Timer being toggable would help reduce the clutter. Lastly, I want to implement features to give the user more power to customize their Kanban so it can fit each individual user's need.
